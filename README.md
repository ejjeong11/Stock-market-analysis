# Stock-market-analysis

## Project Background
For the first quarter of 2022, all major stock benchmarks dropped significantly, ranging from a 4.6% decline for the S&P 500 to as much as 9% for the Nasdaq Composite.

This vast market impact came from the combination of various economic issues including supply chain, inflation, and Russia's invasion.

The biggest reason is the high inflation in the U.S. This led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates after the near-zero rate at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine threatened the business investment and consumer spending.

Therefore, in this project, I would like to analyze what financial and accounting factors affected the stock returns during market shock of early 2022.
